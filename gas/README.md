# Gas Price Calculator
Calculator that uses [Google Maps Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/) and ~~current~~ gas prices to estimate the share of gas money to be paid to friends and drivers.

Created during my summer in LA when I was hitching rides from friends.

The Gas Price API gives data that's 4 years old so for now I'm using the average gas price in LA during July 2016 ($2.45).

Currently calculates MPG's for my friend's 2001 Suzuki Esteem sedan 4 cyl, 1.6 L, Automatic 4-spd, which gets 26 miles per gallon.

Things to add: updated gas prices, different make/model cars.
