<h1 id='title'>Gas Money Calculator</h1>
<p>This interactive web app uses the Google Maps Distance Matrix API, local gas prices*, and your car's make and model and its MPG** to effectively estimate the share of gas money to pay to your friend or driver.</p>
<p class='x-small'>The inspiration for this web app came during summer 2016 when I was living in LA. My roommate, Bryan, was always driving me around so I created this calculator so I knew around how much gas money to toss him whenever we went on a long drive somewhere.</p>

<p>* Ok, I lied. The API responsible for finding local gas prices is currently down so I hard-coded the "local" gas price to be $2.45, which was the price at the Chevron near where I lived in LA.</p>
<p>** Ok, I lied again. The API to find MPG based on make/model isn't available for free so I used 26 mpg, which is about right for Bryan's (my friend) <a href='https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2001_Suzuki_Esteem.shtml'>2001 Suzuki Esteem sedan 4 cyl, 1.6 L, Automatic 4-spd</a>.</p>
