<h1 id='title'>Classics 28: The Story of Daedalus and Icarus</h1>
<p>This is a game inspired by Flappy Bird. In the classic myth of Daedalus and Icarus, the father-son duo escapes from King Minos's castle on the island of Crete. Since King Minos will capture them if they escape by ground or water, Daedalus and Icarus can only escape by air. Daedalus is a famous inventor and creates wings from him and his son to use. He warns Icarus not to fly too high because the sun will melt the wax holding the wings, and not too low because the water will ruin them.</p>
